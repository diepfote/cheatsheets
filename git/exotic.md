```
# To check what will be deleted run with --dry-run and remove --invert-paths
# --> will only add matched commits (commits you want to delete --> invert)
git filter-repo --dry-run --path specific-file-or-dir/ --path-glob '*partial-name-in-subfolder*'

# --invert-paths --> to exclude these matches, otherwise all other
# commits would be dropped
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path specific-file-or-dir/ --path-glob '*partial-name-in-subfolder*'

  * `<rev>^{/<text>}, e.g. HEAD^{/fix nasty bug}`
  A suffix `^` to a revision parameter, followed by a brace pair that contains a text led by a slash, is the same as the `:/fix nasty bug` syntax below except that it returns the youngest matching commit which is reachable from the `<rev>` before `^`.

```
git show :/<pattern to match youngest commit message>
```

## git clang-format

Snatched from https://offlinemark.com/2021/04/02/surgical-formatting-with-git-clang-format/

### one commit
* Change files to your heartâ€™s content. Be messy.
* Stage your changes by running git add
* Format changes by running git clang-format


### messy dev branch

* Make a new dev branch and squash all commits into one using git rebase
* Use git reset --soft to bring the single squashed commit into the staging tree
* Run git clang-format to format the squashed commit and add formatting changes to working tree
* git checkout back to original dev branch to apply the formatting changes for the whole branch in one commit

### alternate format

```
$ git clang-format --style=WebKit
$ git clang-format --style=file # if you have an existing .clang-format
```
