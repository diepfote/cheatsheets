# Cheatsheets

Meant to be viewed by the `cheat` alias at <https://github.com/diepfote/scripts/blob/b840b338b0993ad853e88a70ea9ada75ae3f1925/source-me/posix-compliant-shells.sh#L122>

LICENSE only applies to my own content 
(if it is an html page or a PDF it is almost 
a hundred percent nicked from somewhere else.)
