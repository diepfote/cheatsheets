# Multi Line Edit shortcuts
#

* <CTRL>+<SHIFT>+C  ...  enable multi line mode
* <CTRL>+<y>        ... set multi line cursor

The new plugin introduces a new ‘mode’ in which you can do multi editing. You enter this mode by Ctrl+Shift+C, and once enabled you can start inserting edit points manually by pressing Ctrl+E at any point in the document. Additionally, you can use Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End to respectively insert edit points at the beginning or end of the line automatically
